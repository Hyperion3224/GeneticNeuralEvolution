# ABOUT

This is a passion project running on a server of hopes and dreams. The server is 8 2015 Mac Minis and 1 old thinkpad edu edition connected via ethernet.
If you want to steal some of my code for your own projects please do! You will have to configure my settings and such so that it fits your machine specs, but by all means go for it.
